/**
 * - user_name_label, password_label, signature_label, subject_label - these
 * are generally about telling the plugin what to call these when they pass
 * them to Omnipay. They are also shown to users so some reformatting is done
 * to turn it into lower-first-letter camel case. Take a look at the gateway
 * file for your gateway. This is directly under src. Some provide more than
 * one and the 'getName' function distinguishes them. The getDefaultParameters
 * will tell you what to pass. eg if you see
 * 'apiKey' you should enter 'user_name' => 'Api Key' (you might ? be able to
 * get away with 'API Key' - need to check). You can provide as many or as few
 * as you want of these and it's irrelevant which field you put them in but
 * note that the signature field is the longest and that in future versions of
 * CiviCRM hashing may be done on password and signature on the screen.
 *
 * - 'class_name' => 'Payment_OmnipayMultiProcessor', (always)
 *
 * - 'url_site_default' - this is ignored. But, by giving one you make it
 * easier for people adding processors
 *
 * - 'billing_mode' - 1 = onsite, 4 = redirect offsite (including transparent
 * redirects).
 *
 * - payment_mode - 1 = credit card, 2 = debit card, 3 = transparent redirect.
 * In practice 3 means that billing details are gathered on-site so it may also
 * be used with automatic redirects where address fields need to be mandatory
 * for the signature.
 *
 * The record will be automatically inserted, updated, or deleted from the
 * database as appropriate. For more details, see "hook_civicrm_managed" at:
 * http://wiki.civicrm.org/confluence/display/CRMDOC/Hook+Reference
